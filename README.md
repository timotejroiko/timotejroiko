# Hello there

I'm Tim, a Slovenian dude born in Germany, raised in Portugal and currently living in Brazil!

Im a JavaScript enthusiast and professional nerd who develops high quality open source libraries on NPM. I also run a successful Discord bot and a powerful astronomy API. In my free time i like helping other developers, especially beginner developers on Discord and elsewhere.

My main interest is researching, benchmarking and delivering custom high-performance JavaScript solutions to specific problems.

Oh yes, I also read Astrology and Human Design charts :)

PS: Most of my work is offered free of charge and licensed under MIT, however if you use my open source libraries in a commercial product or business, consider subscribing to the appropriate sponsorship level [here](https://github.com/sponsors/timotejroiko) and get priority support for your company.
