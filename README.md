# Hi

Hi there, I'm Tim, a Slovenian dude born in Germany, raised in Portugal and currently living in Brazil!

Im a JavaScript enthusiast and professional nerd who develops high quality open source libraries on NPM. I also run a successful Discord bot and a powerful astronomy API. In my free time i like helping other developers, especially beginner developers on Discord and elsewhere.

My main interest is researching, benchmarking and delivering custom high-performance JavaScript solutions to specific problems.

Oh yes, I also read Astrology and Human Design charts :)
